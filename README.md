# RPG Core Combat System using Unity and C#
**Author:** *Aum Garasia* \
This project is for the mandatory B.Tech Summer Internship 2022. \
This project is a working prototype of a combat system coded using C# in Unity game engine. \

## Functionalities

### Click-to-move 
The player only needs to use his mouse to attack at enemy, or simply move about in the world.

### Health System
Player and enemies have different haelth points which get depleted when in combat. \
**Keep your HP up, you'll need it!**

### Enemy AI
1. The player will get attacked as soon as it reaches in the range of enemy.
2. Apart from attacking the player, if the player manages to get out of reach, the enemy will still be *suspicious* and stay there until the cooldown time expires.
3. The enemies will also patrol around an area, *protecting* it from us.( Not for long though ;) )

### Cinematics, Portals, weapons, stats and a lot more!
